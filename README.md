## Description
In Odin Battleship, a player plays against the computer in a game of battleship. The player has 7 ships (1x length 5, 1x length 4, 1x length 3, 2x length 2, 2x length1) to place on a 10x10 grid. The computer also has 7 ships to place on a 10x10 grid. The player and the computer take turns guessing where the other's ships are. The first player to sink all of the other's ships wins.

## How to play
To attack the enemy's ship, the player can click on a square on the enemy's grid. Missed shots are represented with a dot, hit shots are represented with an X, and sunk ships are represented with a red background and a black border. When all of the player's or computer's ships are sunk, the game will end. The player may choose to restart the game at any time.
